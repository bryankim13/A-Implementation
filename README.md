# A-Implementation
Implements the A* search algorithm 

The program takes in the first argument as the path for the world file. 
An example would be java myRobot.java myInputFile4.txt
The O in the inputfile represents a open space while X represents blocked spaces. The robot starts on S and its destination is X. 

The program prints out stats at the end showing how many pings and moves are made. 

To run, it is important to put the HW2.jar as a dependency.
